// If this file contains one or more module names, then they will be prevented from loading.
// This can be useful when sharing a module directory between many bot instances via a symlink.
// However, if modules.include also contains entries, then this file is ignored.
// Lines containing a / are ignored.
// e.g.:
// markov
// twitter
